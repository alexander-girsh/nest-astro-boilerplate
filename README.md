WHAT IS IT
---
Thats the complex boilerplate which allows to bootstrap fullstack web applications powered with astro (https://astro.build) and nest.js (https://nestjs.com) 

NOTICE!
---
* It covers only dev, linting, unit-tests running and local e2e tests running CI stages.
* Now it does not cover the build, migration and production run stage.
* It uses `husky` to perform pre-commit hooks such as linting and running unit and e2e tests


How to use
---
* `git clone <this repository>`
* `yarn install`
* `yarn run dev:backend`
* `yarn run dev:frontend`
